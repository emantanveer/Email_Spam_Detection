# Email_Spam_Detection

This project implements an email spam detection model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on a dataset of emails, with the goal of classifying emails as spam or not spam. It includes visualizations of the model's loss and accuracy over epochs.

## Project Overview
This project uses an LSTM model to detect spam emails. It preprocesses the dataset by tokenizing the text and padding it to a fixed length. The model is trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function.

### Features:
- Preprocessing of email text data (tokenization, padding)
- Model training using LSTM
- Prediction of email spam status
- Plotting loss and accuracy graphs over training epochs
